A challenge of working with complex communities is they are often large and vary across different scales. To test community-level hypotheses in a tractable system, we investigated the effect of divergent microbial community function on host health using the purple pitcher plant, Sarracenia purpurea, as a model system for plant-microbiome interactions. Microbial communities play important roles in mediating the health and stability of ecosystems, where they perform vital functions like cycling nutrients through biosynthesis and decomposition.\n","date":1668729600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1668729600,"objectID":"4912d1529ab14bc805cf6e792901acf6","permalink":"https://jessibernardin.github.io/research/2022-11-18-exp-1/","publishdate":"2022-11-18T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/2022-11-18-exp-1/","section":"research","summary":"To test community-level hypotheses in a tractable system, we investigated the effect of divergent microbial community function on host health using the purple pitcher plant, as a model system for plant-microbiome interactions.","tags":["microbial ecology","plant traits","microbial function"],"title":"Microbial function influences plant traits","type":"research"},{"authors":[],"categories":["fungi"],"content":" Robergea albicedrae is a fungus that grows on the bark and twigs of a single species of tree, the Ashe juniper (Juniperus ashei). First described in 1910, the fungus has been reassigned at the generic and family levels several times over the past century and is now classified in Stictidaceae.\nHistorically, ascomycete fungi have been classified based on key morphological characteristics such as spore size and shape, ascus morphology, and biochemical indicators. This approach has resulted in groups of organisms that are microscopically and macroscopically similar, however, in some situations these groupings are not supported by the results of modern phylogenetic studies.\nThe goal of my study was to provide new morphological and molecular data to better understand the life cycle and relationships of the species.\n","date":1609286400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609286400,"objectID":"8c3208dd98f89d9e3aeafa4aa724ffaa","permalink":"https://jessibernardin.github.io/research/fungi-juniper-community-its/","publishdate":"2020-12-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/fungi-juniper-community-its/","section":"research","summary":"A dusy white fungus grows on the branches and bark of the Ashe Juniper tree.
